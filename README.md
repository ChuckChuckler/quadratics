## What is it?
Quadratics is just a small website I made to help me study quadratic equations for a quiz I have this coming Wednesday.

## How to use it?
Just click one of the three buttons on the page.
Factoring will generate a quadratic equation that should be solved via factoring.
Radicals will generate a quadratic equation that should be solved via square root.
Completing the Square will generate a quadratic equation that should be solved via completing the square.

Once you're satisfied with your answer, click "Show Solution + Steps" to see the answer.

To generate another problem, just click the button again.
